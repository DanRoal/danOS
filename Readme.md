# DanOS. My own operative system!!

As I'm trying to learn Rust, and since I think the best way to learn something new is to force yourself to use it, I decided to start developing my own operative system using Rust

Of course I'm not going to build the next Windows, but I still think it's going to be fun to be learning about low-level concepts at the same time as to try to learn the most I can about this amazing programming language.

The final objective is to try to run this OS that I called DanOS (creative I know) in bare metal. Follow along if you want to learn something too!

I'm using the excelent guide writen by Philipp Oppermann that can be found [here](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
